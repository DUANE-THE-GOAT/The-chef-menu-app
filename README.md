    <h1>Menu App Project</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently working on a project to create a menu app for a chef. The app will have a welcome page with the title 
        <strong>"Welcome to the Menu App"</strong>. On this page, there will be two buttons allowing the chef to add ingredients and view them. 
        Additionally, there will be a dropdown menu where users can select from different categories such as drinks, starters, desserts, and mains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the chef has added the ingredients, there will be another dropdown menu at the top of the page where users can select from a predetermined 
        list to view specific items. I am also planning to create a YouTube video to provide a visual description of the code I have written for this app.
